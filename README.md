## About

This demo implements Bundle and Pivotal indices for food networks using JGraphT library.

<p>BI and PI indices take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual attributes of vertices, for example, threshold of influence (quota);</li>
<li>Possiblity of the group influence;</li>
<li>Indirect connections between vertices via other vertices.</li>
</ul>

Check the [releases](https://github.com/DmitrijEgorow/BundlePivotalIndicesDemo/tags) for pre-built binaries.
